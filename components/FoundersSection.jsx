                Since our first investment in 2012, the majority of our founders
                have raised additional rounds of funding, running teams of up to
                100+ employees. By helping our founders learn the ins and outs
                of fundraising, launch strategy, growth, and hiring, weâ€™re just
                as invested in your mission as you are.
